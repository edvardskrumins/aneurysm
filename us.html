        Implementing cutting edge technology in healthcare over the last decades has opened up new
        possibilities for early detection of intracranial aneurysm as well as there have appeared new
        minimally invasive treatment methods. Previously the only existing treatment for intracranial
        aneurysm was neurosurgical operation. However, recently endovascular embolization of cerebral
        aneurysm has become more widely used and nowadays is believed to have become the “golden
        standard”. AO Solutions was founded in 2014 with the goal of offering professionals in the
        Baltic states the most advanced technological solutions in neuroradiology. Also in 2014 AO
        Solutions signed a contract with a medical technology company from the USA – Blockade
        Medical LLC, whose manufactured products like embolization coils have been recognized by
        experts all around the world. In 2016 Blockade Medical was consolidated by Balt International.

        Stroke is a sudden disabling interruption of the blood flow to the brain caused by thrombosis or
        torn blood vessels and results in an irreparable damage to the brain tissue. Every year
        approximately 15 million patients die due to the severe effects of a stroke. Moreover, in Latvia
        the statistics are quite alarming as well. Often experiencing a stroke is associated with older
        patients even though around 15% of all patients diagnosed with a stroke turn out to be below the
        age of 45. Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients is a meticulous
        procedure during which recanalization methods and various different kinds of devices are used.
        The treatment is applied in cases of acute ischemic stroke, using mechanical devices which can
        significantly reduce the harmful effects of a stroke. This procedure is carried out by highly
